    "`CheckpointReporter` saves periodic checkpoints of a simulation. The checkpoints will overwrite one another, i.e., only the last checkpoint will be saved in the file. Loading a checkpoint will restore a simulation to a reasonably close, but usually not identical, state to when it was written. The checkpoint contains data that is highly specific to the `System`, `Platform`, and the hardware and software of the computer it was created on. If you try and load it on a computer with different hardware, it is likely to fail. Checkpoints created with different versions of OpenMM are often incompatible. \n",
